# Lunch-N-Learns

I am currently a Software Engineer at CPA Global. I work at their location in Boise, Idaho. My role is a full-stack developer with some DevOps work thrown in. 

My team is currently in a process of modernizing and streamlining all aspects of our application. However, due to the fast-paced nature of Web UI development, many of
my coworkers are not in the know when it comes to many popular and essential Web technologies. As such, I created these series of Lunch N' Learns to share my knowledge
with my coworkers.

Due to the mismatch of UI knowledge, most of my presentations will center around an overview of UI-centric technologies. However, as stated earlier, my position and knowledge
reaches far beyond the Web UI world. As such, I might occasionally conduct presentations on UI-centric technologies when applicable

My presentations utilize the fantastic reveal-md library. To view one of my presentations, follow these steps:
* Checkout my source code
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run PRESENTATION_NAME:present`
